LIBERTAS - Blogging Web System


Libertas is a blogging web system that allows users to create and manage their own posts and comments. All content is publicly visible and registered users have full control over their own content. The system enforces flat, non-nested comments and maintain strict ownership rules for edits and deletion. The design would emphasize the content itself, making it the primary focus of the user experience. This approach prioritizes ease of use and eliminates the need for complex backend systems, offering a streamlined experience for users.
